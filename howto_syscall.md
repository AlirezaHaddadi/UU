## **How to write a HelloWorld linux system call?**   
briefly, to write a linux system call and make it working:
1. A linux kernel source should be downloaded and extracted.  
2. A custom system call should be added to the kernel directory and some files(e.g., system calls table, Makefile, etc.) should be updated.
